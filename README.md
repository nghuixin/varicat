GAGE-BD Ontology Visualization
This is a repo containing webpages of visualizations based on an integrated Older Adults with Bipolar Disorder-focused database, the Global Aging & Geriatric Experiments in Bipolar Disorder Database (GAGE-BD) project. GAGE-BD has brought together over 10 international investigators representing a broad geographic distribution and data on over 1,000 OABD. These are visualizations of an ontology created to encompass variables in OABD datasets across study sites worldwide.

The html and jpeg files for each webpage are uploaded in this repo's `visualizations` folder.  If they belong to the Inflammaing dataset, then it will have a "inflammaging_" prefix, if they belong to Integrated GAGE-BD dataset, then it will have a "integrated_gage" prefix. Html and jpeg files **without** prefixes belong to the full ontology.

See GAGE [website]([url](https://gage-bd.org/description-of-wave-1-3/)) for more details.
